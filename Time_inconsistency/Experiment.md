# Experiment Instructions
### This file intends to provide detailed instructions on how to reproduce the experiments in our [paper]().
The main setup of the experiments consists of two parts. The first is algorithms, and the second is the environment. We also 

## 1. Algorithms
We
### 1.1 MC

### 1.2 Soph-EU-Agent

### 1.3 Backward 

## 2. Environment
In this part, we describe how to implement the environments.

### 2.1 Simple Gridworld
Our devise an gridworld environment as shown in the following graph:
